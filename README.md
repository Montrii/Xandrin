# Xandrin
Xandrin offers you the opportunity to interact with the famous 3D era of GTA Games in ways that are hard to imagine!
(Currently, only Xandrin SA is actively being developed on.)
It aims to lift off hard work from Code Monkeys by showcasing all activities in a clean and amusing UI.
By binding certain activities to not more than some button clicks, Xandrin allows you to alter the game to find new glitches or dupes efficiently.
Subsequently, it allows you to learn about the newest found information regarding your preferred game.
Features like visiting speedrun.com or reading the official GTA speedrun chats from the software are in works, however need to be clarified with said moderators to ensure data security.



# How is the software created

The entirety of the UI is writted in C# by using WPF elements.
Altering a games memory is made by using a written .dll in C++ which is simply being executed by Xandrin.
